# DOM FREE example code
This is example code for DOM FREE, available here: https://github.com/infoAtDomFree/dom-free

## This sample is runnable from your device after doing a git clone
You will want to load either index_cjs.html (using Classic Javascript) or index_esm.html (using modern ECMAscript).

## CHROME exception
Chrome will not allow us to load a .js file from the disk. However, we need to load lib.js. You have two options.
### deploy the .html and .js files to a webserver you control

### Ask Chrome to allow you to load local files.
Here's how you do that (in Windows):
```start chrome --allow-file-access-from-files```

# what the sample demonstrates
There are several buttons that each demonstrate a capability you might want to use in you DOM-based JavaScript code.

You can see the code that is running in HTML and in lib.js.
